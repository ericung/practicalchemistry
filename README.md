# Practical Chemistry
A guide to making money and experimenting as an individual by using chemistry.
------
## Organic Chemistry
### Chemistry of Food
Studying compound foods is more efficient than studying isolated molecules. Akin to lifting weights, it's more efficient to do compound exercises first and then study the isolation exercies.
By doing this, there is reason and intuition to experiment and isolate compounds and molecules.
#### Protein
1. Vegetable Proteins
2. Meat Proteins
   
Or better yet explained

1. Incomplete Proteins
2. Complete Proteins

Figuring out how to get adequate protein intake is important for strength goals
* Slowly increase the intake of protein to body weight or whatever weight you desire
------
#### Carbohydrates
1. Simple Carbohydrates
2. Complex Carbohydrates

Figure out how to get adequate carbohydrate intake is important for cardio goals
* Figure out the proper amount
------
#### Fat
##### Bad Fats
1. Saturated
2. Trans
##### Good Fats
1. Monounsaturated
2. Polyunsaturated 

Food Oils
* Edible oils ie. fish oils
* Cooking oils ie. peanut oils

Figure out how much fat is needed not just for fitness but for brain activity. Fats play a part in mental gymnastics
* Figure out the right amount
------
### Beauty and Body Products
1. Starting with the basics
	* Natural Compounds for facial skin care
		* Got acne?
		* Want smooth skin?
	* Natural compounds for body care ie. sunscreen and lotion
		* Best sun screen for you
		* Get smoother skin?
	* Compounds for nails and dying hair
		* Best polish and paint for nails
		* Best dye for you
2. Working at barbershops, nail salons, beauty parlors, and massage rooms

### Non-Edible Oils
Used for planes, trains, and automobiles
* Lubricants for oils like grease
* Petroleum, fuel and gas => Their cost => Working at a gas station
------
### Painting
* Painting houses, appliances, and metal
* Stripping, priming, and finishing wood
------
### Recyclable Trash

-----
## Inorganic Chemistry
------
### Tools in construction and the cost just like Minecraft
* Materials to handle water, dirt, sand, concrete, minerals, and metal
------
### Mechanical things and the most effective solutions for transportation
* Bicycles and their materials
* Cars and their materials
* Being a driver
* Being a mechanic
------
### 3D Printing and Choosing the best materials for the cost
* Home 3D Printing and 3D programs to create tools
	* Sports Equipment
	* Useful everyday equipments
* Being a CAD/CAM Designer
------
### Maids and janitors
* Bleach
* Disinfectants
* All purpose
* Baking Soda
------
#### Recyclable Trash
------

## Electrochemistry
-----
### Designing Energy Systems Related to Renewable Energy
* Affordable ways to create a simple renewable energy system for Home Depot
	* Solar Panels
		* Parts of solar panels and their ability to collect electricity
	* Batteries
		* Parts of batteries and their ability to store electricity
	* Wires
		* Types of and their ability to handle electricity
* Making a dashboard that computes weather if you can't fund it
------
### Components of a Computer
* Parts of Computer
	* CPU
	* RAM
	* Hard Drive - HDDs and SSDs
	* Motherboards
	* Circuits
	* Fans
* Working as a computer technician
------
#### Recyclable Trash

## Quantum Chemistry and Physics
### Using 2D programs like javascript to create models for free
* Figure out the distance formula between two points
* Figure out how rotation of an image works
* Figure out how gravity works on a 2D plane
### Using 3D programs like Blender and Unity to create models for free
* Essentially the same as 2D but in 3D
### Thinking about computational complexity by relating it to the age old physics problem
