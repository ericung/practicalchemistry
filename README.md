# Practical Chemistry
Making money and experimenting as an individual by using chemistry

## Organic Chemistry
### Chemistry of Food
Studying compounds foods is more efficient than studying isolated molecules. Akin to lifting weights, it's more efficient to do compound exercises first and then study the isolation exercies.
By doing this, there is reason to experiment and isolate compounds and molecules.
#### Protein
1. Vegetable Proteins
2. Meat Proteins
   
Or better yet explained

1. Incomplete Proteins
2. Complete Proteins
#### Beauty and Body Products
* Natural Compounds for facial skin care
* Natural compounds for body care ie. sunscreen and lotion
#### Whats in your body
#### Non-Edible Oils
Used for planes, trains, and automobiles
* Lubricants for oils like grease
* Petroleum, fuel and gas => Their cost => Working at a gas station
#### Painting
* Painting houses, appliances, and metal
* Stripping, priming, and finishing wood
#### Types of Compostable Trash

## Inorganic Chemistry
### Tools in construction and the cost just like Minecraft
* Materials to handle water, dirt, sand, concrete, minerals, and metal
### Mechanical things and the most effective solutions for transportation
* Bicycles and their materials
* Cars and their materials
* Being a professional truck driver
### 3D Printing and Choosing the best materials for the cost
* Home 3D Printing and 3D programs to create tools
	* Sports Equipment
	* Useful everyday equipments
* Being a CAD/CAM Designer
#### Types of Recyclable Trash


## Electrochemistry
### Designing Energy Systems Related to Renewable Energy
* Affordable ways to create a simple renewable energy system for Home Depot
	* Solar Panels
		* Parts of solar panels and their ability to collect electricity
	* Batteries
		* Parts of batteries and their ability to store electricity
	* Wires
		* Types of and their ability to handle electricity
### Components of a Computer
* Parts of Computer
	* CPU
	* RAM
	* Hard Drive - HDDs and SSDs
	* Motherboards
	* Circuits
	* Fans
#### Types of Recyclable Trash

## Quantum Chemistry and Physics
### Using 2D programs like javascript to create models for free
### Using 3D programs like Blender and Unity to create models for free
